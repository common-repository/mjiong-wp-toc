== Description ==
This is actually not a brand new plug-in, but based on the [Table of Contents Plus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/table-of-contents-plus/) improvements. Since the original plug-in has not been updated for a long time, I would like to continue to improve this plug-in. The original code has not changed, just added some new code:

> 1, the original features are retained  
> 2, new page scrolling monitor, automatic link article directory highlighting

这其实不是一个全新的插件，而是基于[Table of Contents Plus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/table-of-contents-plus/)改进的，由于原插件已经很久没更新了，所以想继续改进这个插件。原来的代码没有改动，只是新增加了一些代码：
> 1、原有的功能都保留  
> 2、新增页面滚动监听，自动链接文章目录高亮显示
